In EHGCN, we introduce a multi-scale voxel grids Gaussian denosing and sampling strategy, retaining discriminative events while attenuating chaotic noise. Then, we present a Markov Random Field (MRF)-optimized motion-aware hyperedge generation method, which minimizes an energy function to explicitly capture consistent motion patterns within short time intervals, thereby eliminating cross-target spurious associations and providing critically topological priors while capturing long-range dependencies among events. Finally, we propose a Euclidean-hyperbolic GCN to fuse the information densely aggregated and hierarchically modeled in local Euclidean and global hyperbolic spaces, respectively, to achieve a hybrid event perception. Experimental results on event perception tasks, such as object detection and recognition, show the effectiveness of our approach.
