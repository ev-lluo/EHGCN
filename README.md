Event camera data exhibit strong anisotropy in spatio-temporal distribution:

After modeling with Euclidean GCN, it shows clear intra-class structures in local neighborhoods, but with severe inter-class overlap. In contrast, hyperbolic space can clearly separate inter-class structures, but with excessive intra-class compression.
